# Hi 👋, I'm Eugenie!
<br/>

### I'm a mission-driven Backend/Full-Stack Software Engineer.
<br/>

- 💻 I have 7+ years of experience building scalable systems serving millions of users, and I specialize in Python/Django.

- ❤️ I love learning new languages and technologies to build features that deliver measurable impact and value to the user. I start small but think big.

- 🤗 I care. I care about the user, the team, and the craft. I seek constructive feedback and foster empathy.

- 😖 I don't like tech debt and bugs! (although I do enjoy debugging and fixing them) That's why I take pride in writing clean and maintainable code along with thorough unit and integration tests. And I do review test files in PRs too 🔍

- ⚡ Fun fact: I started my professional career in the entertainment industry, working on the production and postproduction of TV shows and feature films. I heavily contributed to a crime show very successful in France that ended up being aired in over 80 countries! I enjoyed the cross-team collaboration, adaptability, and get-things-done attitude that it took to a diverse team to bring a vision to life.
