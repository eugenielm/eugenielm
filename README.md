# Hi 👋, I'm Eugenie!
<br/>

### I'm a mission-driven Backend/Full-Stack Software Engineer.
<br/>

💻 I have 7+ years of experience building scalable systems serving millions of users, and I specialize in Python/Django.

❤️ I love learning new languages and technologies to build features that deliver measurable impact and value to the user.

🤗 I care. I care about the user, the team, and the craft. I seek constructive feedback and foster empathy.

🏗️ I start small but think big. Navigating ambiguity brings me to the aha moments that make building solutions for real problems so fulfilling.

😖 I don't like tech debt and bugs--although I do enjoy debugging and fixing them! That's why I take pride in writing clean and maintainable code along with thorough unit and integration tests. I do review test files in PRs too 🔍

⚡ Fun fact: I started my professional career in the entertainment industry, working on the production and post-production of TV shows and feature films. I heavily contributed to a crime show that was very successful in France and ended up being aired in over 80 countries! That's where I developed my love for cross-team collaboration and the get-things-done attitude it takes to bring a shared vision to life.
