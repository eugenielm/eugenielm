# Hi 👋, I'm Eugenie!
<br/>

### I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer driven by the mission, the team, and the craft.
<br/>

- ❤️ I love learning new technologies to build high impact features end-to-end that deliver measurable impact and great value for the users.

- 😖 I don't like bugs! (although I do enjoy debugging and fixing them) That's why I take pride in writing clean and maintainable code along with thorough unit and integration tests. And I do review test files in PRs too 🔍

- ⚡ Fun fact: I started my professional career in the entertainment industry, working on the production and postproduction of TV shows and movies, which includes a crime show very successful in France that ended up being aired in over 80 countries! This experience taught me team work, cross-team collaboration, adaptability, and how to go the extra mile for the vision. And I took these values with me when I transitioned to software engineering.
